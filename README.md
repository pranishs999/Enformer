# Enformer

we have used Django as a back-end and HTML_CSS as the front-end.
Djanjo has been quite a hassle to deal and the front-end part is most tricky one, so we settle for less  for now thinking it as only a prototype and not a full fledge website that deals with a lot of complex data.
We have done some research on Event managing company like ours...but we are not able to find such type of application in nepal but we found some of them in other countries.
For instance, EventBrite is an website that manages the whole event as we have planned to do in future.
Another example is MeetUp which does the similar works as our future plans
We have found one type that list such upcoming events in nepal but it was not that quite effective as it is facebook/social media based only rather than ours which is website based.
The market size is quite big as such you will not find any cities without any type of events..that makes us globally available.
